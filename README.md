# \# OS / Embedded C Survival Project

# 

# Goal:

# Prepare myself for Operating Systems and Embedded Operating Systems courses.

# 

# Principles:

# \- Focus on memory, pointer, and system-level C

# \- Every example must be explainable with memory layout

# \- No magic, no copy-paste without understanding

# 

# Rule:

# If I cannot draw the memory, I do not understand the code.

#
